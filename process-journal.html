                <p>High-rise window washer is an autonomous cleaning drone. It was designed for building manager and town house households. It can help people to wash the high-rise windows quickly and easily, because it requires for only an app to operate. Users can set the cleaning time, location and mode through the app on your mobile phone. You can put your phone aside and focus on the work you are busy now, waiting for the drone to be automatically cleaned and recycled. During this time, the building includes every glass will be showed on a mobile phone using a 3D model, and you can check the cleanliness of the building from your mobile phone at any time. And a simple-structure building usually takes about ten minutes to clean up. The using process is absolutely safe and can reduce the unnecessary casualties of those high-rise window washers. However, please don’t worry about this will make those high-rise window washers lose their jobs, because you can also hire a professional cleaner to help you manually clean the complex buildings with this cleaning drone by the app.</p>

                <p>First of all, we did some research online about the uses of drones. The drones can fly for long periods of time at a controlled level of speed and height and have a role in many aspects of aviation. Nowadays, drones have many functions, such as photography, filming, delivering goods, surveillance and targeted attacks. For example, target drones are used as a target for military to train soldiers. Additionally, The transit drones are commonly. For examples, California start-up Zipline International is instituting plans to deliver blood to transfusion clinics across Rwanda. In Haiti, doctors Without Borders ran a test delivering dummy TB samples by drone. In the US, the first FAA-approved drone delivery of medical supplies happened last year in rural Virginia.</p>

                <p>We have considered about two concepts before. The first one is an auto-attendant machine, which can detect students face one by one and mark the roll. Because some students may drop out of class, they will ask their classmates to mark the roll for them. This machine can force everyone student to come to class.<br>The second one is library-keeper robot, it can help people automatically return books or find books. So it will save lots of time for people.<br>The last one is an automatic matching machine, which can help girls choose clothes that suit today's weather and occasions. <br>However, we want to focus on people's safety and come up with an idea to replace a certain occupation. Therefore,  we noticed a news about the falling of a high-rise window washer, which is the inspiration of our concept.</p>

                <p><strong> ● High-rise Window Washer</strong><br><i><strong>KEY WORDS:</strong> Safety, Privacy, Professional, Job</i></p>
                <p>High-rise window cleaner is the occupation that we want to replace with autonomous drone. Because the safety of high-rise window washers are serious. I did some research online, and I found that there are many accidents about high-rise window cleaner falling to death. Earlier in May, two window washers had to be rescued from the 45th floor of a Tribeca skyscraper when wind twisted the cables of their scaffold, rendering it inoperable; when police arrived, the scaffold was hanging perpendicular to the building. Last November, a similar situation arose in Midtown on the 50th floor of a building near Columbus Circle; when their scaffold got stuck, two window washers had to be pulled into the building through a window. Moreover, last August, one window-washer fell to his death from a 12th-story window to a sixth-story courtyard when the hook supporting his safety harness broke. </p>

                  <br>
                <p>Furth more, the wages of washers cannot afford their lives. In July, The window washers who dangle from Chicago’s glassy high-rises traded in their squeegees for picket signs Monday as they went on strike to demand higher wages and better benefits. Apart from that, washers can see the privacy of household through windows during the working, sometimes people will be frightened by the washers because they always stay outside window suddenly. I asked the building manager when the cleaning started, and he said tomorrow and he will call me when the cleaners come so that I can observe how the window washers working and take some photos. Therefore, this job is dangerous and the washers cannot get enough money. </p>

                <p>Building manager has lots of business to do. Cleaning each building is an important thing. We have interviewed two building managers face to face to get more information. They are managing the apartment of mine and my neighbor. Because my apartment would have a window cleaning next week. And we want more details about the preparation before high-rise window cleaning. From the interview, I know that, the building need to be cleaned once a month. And building managers have to pay 20 thousands dollars for all buildings. The cleaning times will keep two weeks. In spite of the building managers do not have to prepare the ropes for the washers, they still need to do is notice it on the lift and check the anchor point to make sure everyone will be safe.</p>

                <p>When I go home after class, I noticed that the town houses in Ivy Street. Because all the houses are very high and looked like not easy to get cleaning. So I make a questionnaire and send them to my friends who live in the town house. And I also did some interviews. From the results, most of townhouse have two to three floors, and the townhouse household would not contact with the high-rise windows cleaning company. A few people will clean by themselves. </p>

                <p>I think that most of apartment household usually don’t have to worry about the high-rise window cleaning. Because they paying property fees monthly, and the building manager will keep building cleaning. Anyway, I invited some of my friend who lived in the apartment to do an online short interview. And the results are same as I expected: no one will worry about the windows cleaning. But some of them was frightened by the high-rise window washer.</p>

And we make a list about the advantages of these two concepts. After that, we started to draw the interface of app on paper. When it is finished, each group member has to evaluate the two concept to give some suggestions, and write some notes on the paper. Then the person who drew this concept need to draw more interfaces and modify the sketches to make it more comfort for users. </p>

We cut it from the paper and give users to survey for the development of this application. And they gave us some advice, such as ‘Don’t have a page of connecting’ , ‘The differences of basic and pro are not clearly’ ‘Too complex and difficult to understand if there are no annotates’ and ‘How to make sure about the drone won’t fall to the ground and make somebody hurts?’ to improve the user experiences. After that, we mixed the two concepts because we found that both concepts have a certain amount of market demand. By arranging feedback from the evaluation, most of the participants believe that the two concepts can be combined and improved, so that the user can could adopt the application into their business and lifestyle. Anyway, we did a testing again after the combination. Actually, they think the interfaces are great, and they are satisfied with our help page specially. Compared to the history interface, they believed that this feature can help them effectively solve the problems encountered in use.</p>

                <p>Now it is the time to get a version of SKETCH. Our main color of the interface is blue, green and white. According to the trichromatic theory proposed in the 19th century by Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz, states that the retina's three types of cones are preferentially sensitive to blue, green, and red. In addition, we did some changes to make it more good-looking. In homepage, we changed the size of ‘START’ button, to make it to be more different from the other three buttons. It can make people know that they should touch this button to get started use the window washer machines. Additionally, we moved the remind image to the top, which is a notification now. Moreover, for  users can see the whole processing of cleaning, we add a 3d model to instead of the building. The green windows means cleaning over, and the grey ones mean that have not been cleaned yet. Due to the feedback of the users, we modified the summary section to make it more good-looking. </p>
